## About the Course

This course, offered by **Cod3r**, is one of the most comprehensive available for web development, consisting of nearly 600 lessons divided into 33 chapters with over 85 hours of content. It covers both **frontend** and **backend** development, using modern frameworks such as **React**, **Vue**, **Angular**, and **Node.js**, along with databases like **MySQL** and **MongoDB**.

Throughout the course, I developed multiple real-world projects that simulate real-world applications, ranging from simple to complex. These projects are designed to strengthen fullstack development skills, incorporating core concepts of **JavaScript**, **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **Gulp**, **Webpack**, **Bootstrap**, **React**, **Angular**, and **Vue.js**.

## Technologies Covered

Here’s a summary of the technologies used in these projects:

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Vue.js, Angular 9, Bootstrap, jQuery
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, MongoDB
- **Build Tools**: Gulp, Webpack
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Desktop Application**: Electron JS
- **Other Technologies**: ESNext (ES6+), AJAX, Promises, Async/Await, Flexbox, CSS Grid

## Projects

### Project 1: JavaScript Basics

- **Description**: A project focused on learning the fundamentals of JavaScript. It includes examples of variables, functions, arrays, objects, and DOM manipulation.
- **Technologies**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Folder**: `javascript-basics/`

### Project 2: Node.js Fundamentals

- **Description**: Backend project where I learned how to set up a server using Node.js and Express.js, handle HTTP requests, and connect to a MySQL database.
- **Technologies**: Node.js, Express.js, MySQL

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into different folders, each containing a specific project. Below is the structure of the main folders:

```bash
web-modern-projects/
│
├── javascript-basics/        # JavaScript Basics Project
├── nodejs-fundamentals/      # Node.js Backend Project
├── fullstack-web-app/        # Fullstack Web Application
├── electron-desktop-app/     # Electron JS Desktop App for Subtitle Processing
│
└── README.md                 # Project Documentation
```

Each project folder contains its own `README.md` with instructions on how to run and install dependencies.

## How to Run the Projects

To run each project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-modern-projects.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific project folder:
   ```bash
   cd javascript-basics
   ```

3. Install dependencies (for projects using Node.js or front-end frameworks like React):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the project (for example, using a local server or `npm start` for Node.js projects).

For more specific instructions, refer to the individual README files in each project folder.
